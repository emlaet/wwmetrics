\title{Measures of Within-Country Diversity (Religion and Language).}
\format{A tibble with 120 observations and 3 variables:
\itemize{
  \item Country. Factor indicating the country (ISO3 code).
  \item Religious_Diversity. Numeric. As reported in the article "The Effects of Within-Country Linguistic and Religious Diversity on Foreign Acquisitions" (JIBS, April 2016, v47-3: 319-346) two measures of within-country diversity were created using essentially the same data as was used to create the linguistic distance and religious distance scales (see [documentation on psychic distance stimuli]{https://sites.google.com/site/ddowresearch/home/scales}). For linguistic diversity, the indices are constructed such that a value of 1 represents the situation where no two individuals within the country speak the same language.  Conversely a value of 0 represents the situation where every individual within the country speaks the same language.

  \item Language_Diversity. Numeric.

For religious diversity, the indices are constructed such that a value of 1 represents the situation where no two individuals within the country adhere to the same religion.  Conversely a value of 0 represents the situation where every individual within the country adheres to the same religion.
