\description{
Data on bilateral trade from [CEPII]{http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/welcome.asp} from 2001 to 2014. Given that most observations in this database report imports and not exports (429 765 vs 20 117 respectively), import data was transformed into export data to be subsequently included in the statistical analyses: if France imports $5m of products and services from Poland, it is equivalent to say that Poland exports $5m to France, so for imports FRA-POL=$5m and for exports POL-FRA=$5m.
