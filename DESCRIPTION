Description: The aim of this package is to gather publicly available (but not always easily accessible or well-known) data in a convenient and tidy way to facilitate empirical studies in the fields of international business, international economics and international management.    It contains data (time-variant or not, bilateral or not) on a diverse set of indicators: geographic distance, cultural distance using Hofstede's cultural dimensions, psychic distance stimuli (Dow & Karunaratna, 2006), longitudinal administrative distance using the Worldwide Governance Indicators from the World Bank, etc.
